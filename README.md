# Resin Input Output Table
This project builds a detailed Input-Output (I-O) table for the U.S. plastics and rubber products manufacturing sector (NAICS 326), with a focus on resin production (NAICS 325211) and its downstream end-markets. The goal is to quantify supply-chain linkages between resin producers, intermediate processors, and end-use industries.
